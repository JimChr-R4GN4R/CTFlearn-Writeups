This was much easier than it says.

I downloaded the zip file and it has these folders:

- MACOSX
- The FLag

So I clicked "The Flag" folder and it had these folder/files:

- .ThePassword (dot at the beginning means that it's hidden file or folder)
- The Flag.pdf
- .DS_Store

So our file that has the flag is obviously "The Flag.pdf" which has password which can be found in .ThePassword folder.

In .ThePassword folder, there is a text file ThePassword.txt which contains this text:

<code>Nice Job!  The Password is "Im The Flag".</code>

So the pdf file's password is <code>Im The Flag</code>

And just like that,we got the flag!

Flag: ABCTF{T3Rm1n4l_is_C00l}
