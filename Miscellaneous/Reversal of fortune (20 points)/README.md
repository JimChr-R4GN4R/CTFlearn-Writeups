Our team of agents have been tracking a hacker that sends cryptic messages to other hackers about what he's doing. We intercepted the below message he sent recently, can you figure out what it says? He mentions his hacker name in it, that's the code you need.

If you are a pro crypto CTF hunter like me (Not at all :P)

you will see that the encrypted text is just reversed.

I used this to reverse it: http://spellbackwards.com/

and got this:

`Next target identified, I need help with some coding, specifically java, message me using my handle FlipRever$eIt if you can.`
