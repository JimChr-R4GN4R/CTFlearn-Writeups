This challenge is very special because I solved it with my beloved sister!
If she wasn't here to help me at the last part of the challenge,I am not sure I would solve it <3

So let's start!

First I searched on google 'Upsidedown text' and found this: http://www.upsidedowntext.com/

So I pasted the link he gives us and got this:

`https://pastebin.com/khGCq7XY`

Then I checked the text which you can find it in `pastebin_text.txt`

and searched on google 'esoteric programming language with questionmark dot and exclamation mark' .

The first webpage it gave was 
`dcode.fr - Ook! Programming Language - Decoder, Encoder, Solver ...`

So we found the encryption which is `Ook`!

got in the page : https://www.dcode.fr/ook-language

and pasted the text (with no argument).

and got this:
http://www.epuzzle.info/puzzlegraj5.php?prefs=3&obrazek=214713&szer=936&wys=525

Then visited the link and gave my name.

Then it showed a puzzle which I should solve.

It took me some time around 30 minutes but finally solved it! (not all,but it was enough :P)

You can find the unsolved puzzle in `unsolved_puzzle.png` and the solved one in `solved_puzzle.png`
