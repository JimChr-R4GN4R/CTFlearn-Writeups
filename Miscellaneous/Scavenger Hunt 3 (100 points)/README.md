This challenge is very special because I solved it with my beloved sister!
If she wasn't here to help me at the last part of the challenge,I am not sure I would solve it <3

So let's start!

First I searched on google 'Upsidedown text' and found this: http://www.upsidedowntext.com/

So I pasted the link he gives us and got this:

`https://pastebin.com/khGCq7XY`

Then I checked the text which you can find it in `pastebin_text.txt`

and searched on google 'esoteric programming language with questionmark dot and exclamation mark' .

The first webpage it gave was 
`dcode.fr - Ook! Programming Language - Decoder, Encoder, Solver ...`

So we found the encryption which is `Ook`!

got in the page : https://www.dcode.fr/ook-language

and pasted the text (with no argument).

and got this:
http://www.epuzzle.info/puzzlegraj5.php?prefs=3&obrazek=214713&szer=936&wys=525

Then visited the link and gave my name.

Then it showed this puzzle which I should solve.

It took me some time around 30 minutes but finally solved it! (not all,but it was enough :P)

You can find the solved one in `solved_puzzle.png` 

If you see closely up and left of the puzzle,there is a counter that shows you when you put a part at the right place.

With it's help you can solve it ;)

So after solving it I copied the link which shows.

`https://goo.gl/4fEuSJ`

So I entered this address and got in this google drive file:

https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B1jsUOdZsv0hNzBiclljcU9PVU0/view

You can view it's content in `google_file_text.txt` .

File's name is 'Who is this?.txt'

Then I opened it with notepad and zoomed out as much as I could and realized that I should find his name...

I supposed that his name was here:

But I could not figure out what was his name...

Then I brought here my sister :D !!!

And we figured out that it was saying 'heije' XDXDXD

So we searched heije american general (American because you can see at the background the US flag and general because that's what I was thinking...)

We found nothing and we decided to just search on google images 'american general' ...

After much of funny scrolling we found this one which had the same hat symbol!!!:

![Image3](https://github.com/JimChr-R4GN4R/CTFlearn-Writeups/blob/master/Miscellaneous/Scavenger%20Hunt%203%20(100%20points)/image3.png)

If you check closely, you will see that it has two anchors. That means that our guy is a general in naval army!!!

Right away we changed our search to 'american general naval'

And after some scrolling and checking we found a photo that had a similar background...

Then we started checking and viewing photos based on this background until this one:

![Image4](https://github.com/JimChr-R4GN4R/CTFlearn-Writeups/blob/master/Miscellaneous/Scavenger%20Hunt%203%20(100%20points)/image4.png)

So, do you see something...???

![Image5](https://github.com/JimChr-R4GN4R/CTFlearn-Writeups/blob/master/Miscellaneous/Scavenger%20Hunt%203%20(100%20points)/image5.png)

This one look familiar to me...

![Image6](https://github.com/JimChr-R4GN4R/CTFlearn-Writeups/blob/master/Miscellaneous/Scavenger%20Hunt%203%20(100%20points)/image6.png)

Bingo!!!

So just searched on google 'Grace Murray Hopper' and got this:

`Grace Hopper - Wikipedia`

Tried it right away and........IT WAS ACCEPTED
