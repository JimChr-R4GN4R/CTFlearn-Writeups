Ever heard of the 5x5 secret message system? If not, basically it's a 5x5 grid with all letters of the alphabet in order, 

without k because c is represented to make the k sound only. Google it if you need to. A letter is identified by Row-Column. 

All values are in caps. 

Try: 1-3,4-4,2-1,{,4-4,2-3,4-5,3-2,1-2,4-3,_,4-5,3-5,}

When saw the 5x5 system, my first thought was polybius square system.

So used this: https://cryptii.com/pipes/polybius-square

and got this: <code>ctfthumbsup</code>

SO tried it but didn't work...

Checked one more time the ciphered text and there was missing the '_' character.
