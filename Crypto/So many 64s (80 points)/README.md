Help! My friend stole my flashdrive that had the flag on it. When he gave it back the flag was changed! 
Can you help me decrypt it?

flag.txt is in the folder

So from the title we figure out that a text is multi encoded with base64.

So coded a script for this situation.

You can check it in this folder.

So just put the text in it and got the flag!

Flag: ABCTF{pr3tty_b4s1c_r1ght?}
