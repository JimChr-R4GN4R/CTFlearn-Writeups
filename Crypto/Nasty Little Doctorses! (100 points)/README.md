So, there were these Medical Doctors, 5 to be exact. 

They had to encrypt all of their passwords with something. 

The 5 M.D.'s were named Bob, Joe, Mike, Sarah, and Jill. 

Get what I'm hinting at yet? 

bafa3de6dac066cebe8c0e5670d98935 is your flag, although indirectly. ;)

So we see a hint from the description...

<code>5 M.D</code> ...

This looks like MD5 encryption....!

So used https://md5.gromweb.com/

and just pasted the md5 text and got the flag!

Flag: CTF{MD5_is_Nasty}
