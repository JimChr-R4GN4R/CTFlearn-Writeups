The vignere cipher is a method of encrypting alphabetic text by using a series of interwoven Caesar ciphers based on the letters of a keyword.

Iâ€™m not sure what this means, but it was left lying around: blorpy

We see from the title that it's vigenete ciphered.

So used https://gchq.github.io and used vigenere decoder.

But we need a key... So checked one more time the decription and tried to put as key <code>blorpy</code>

And found the flag!
