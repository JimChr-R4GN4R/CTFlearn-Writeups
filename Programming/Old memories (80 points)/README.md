General RONX was cleaning up his cupboard last night, 

when he finds this archive out of the blue. He recalls that it was something about what he loves immensely. 

But the old General does not remember what it was. He sent this to me but I don't know what to do with it. 

Can you find it out?

I downloaded two images `1.png` and `2.png` .

Then I opened them and realized that I have to use an image combiner.

I have a tool for forensics called `stegosolve` by Caesum.

So I opened the image combinator and then imported these png files and XORed them and got the flag!


Flag: CTF{I_L0V3_PYTH0N}
